###### Relative mass
(c) explanation of the terms *relative isotopic mass* (mass compared with 1/12th mass of carbon-12) and *relative atomic mass* (weighted mean mass compared with 1/12th mass of carbon-12), based on the mass of a 12C atom, the standard for atomic masses

(d) use of mass spectrometry in:
	(i) the determination of relative isotopic masses and relative abundances of the isotope,
	(ii) calculation of the relative atomic mass of an element from the relative abundances of its isotopes

(e) use of the terms relative molecular mass, Mr , and relative formula mass and their calculation from relative atomic masses.

	(i) prediction of ionic charge from the position of an element in the periodic table
	(i) recall of the names and formulae for the following ions: $\ce {NO3-, CO3^{2-}, SO4^{2-}, OH-, NH4+, Zn^{2+}, Ag+}$

(b) construction of balanced chemical equations (including ionic equations), including state symbols, for reactions studied and for unfamiliar reactions given appropriate information

##### 2.1.3 Amount of substance
###### The mole
(a) explanation and use of the terms:
	(i) *amount of substance*
	(ii) *mole* (symbol 'mol'), as the unit for amount of substance
	(iii) the *Avogadro constant*, $N_A$ (the number of particles per mole, $6.02 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$ )
	(iv) *molar mass* (mass per mole, units $\text{g mol}^{-1}$)
	(v) *molar gas volume* (gas volume per mole, units $\text{dm}^3 \text{ mol}^{-1}$)

###### Determination of formulae
(b) use of the terms:
	(i) *empirical formula* (the simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element present in a compound)
	(ii) *molecular formula* (the number and type of atoms of each element in a molecule)

(c) calculations of empirical and molecular formulae, from composition by mass or percentage compositions by mass and relative molecular mass

(d) the terms, *anhydrous*, *hydrated* and *water of crystallisation* and calculation of the formula of a hydrated salt from given percentage composition, mass composition or based on experimental results
