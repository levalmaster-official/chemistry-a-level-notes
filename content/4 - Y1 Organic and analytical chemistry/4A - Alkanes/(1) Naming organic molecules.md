#### Naming alkanes
2. Identify the longest continuous (parent chain) and name it just like you would a straight chain alkane
3. Identify any side groups in using the prefixes methyl (1 carbon), ethyl (2 carbons), propyl (3 carbons)
4. Number the side groups by the carbon they are attached to in the main chain, keeping the number as low as possible
5. Put the side groups and their positional numbers at the front of the name in alphabetical order, using di/tri/tetra if there are more than one of the same side group (the 'd' or 't' is ignored)
6. Between letters leave no spaces; between numbers put a comma; between a letter and a number put a dash.

| Number of C | Name    | Molecular formula |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | Methane | $\ce{CH4}$        |
| 2           | Ethane  | $\ce{C2H6}$       |
| 3           | Propane | $\ce{C3H8}$       |
| 4           | Butane  | $\ce{C4H10}$      |
| 5           | Pentane | $\ce{C5H12}$      |
| 6           | Hexane  | $\ce{C6H14}$      |
| 7           | Heptane | $\ce{C7H16}$      |
| 8           | Octane  | $\ce{C8H18}$      |
| 9           | Nonane  | $\ce{C9H20}$      |
| 10          | Decane  | $\ce{C10H22}$     |
