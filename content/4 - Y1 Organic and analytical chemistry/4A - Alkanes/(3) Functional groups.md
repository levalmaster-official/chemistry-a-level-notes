#### Homologous series
Many organic molecules contain specifically arranged sets of atoms known as **functional groups**.

Molecules with the same functional groups, only differing by the length of the carbon chain are known as a homologous series.

- Homologous series - a series of organic compounds with the same functional group but with each **successive** member differing by $\ce{C_nH_{2n}}$
- Functional group - a group of atoms responsible for the characteristic reactions of a compounds

#### Organic molecules
- Organic molecule - any molecule containing carbon except $\ce{CO, CO2 and CO3^{2-}}$ (contains C-H bonds)
- Hydrocarbon - organic molecules made up of only carbon and hydrogen
- Alkyl group - an alkane missing one hydrocarbon. It has the general formula $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+1}}$
- Saturated - contains only C-C single bonds
- Unsaturated - contains C=C multiple bonds (double/triple)
- Aromatic - a compound which contains one or more benzene rings ($\ce{C6H6}$)
- Aliphatic - a compound which contains no benzene rings, but rather contains carbon and hydrogen joined together in straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings
- Alicyclic - an aliphatic compound arranged in non-aromatic rings with or without side chains
