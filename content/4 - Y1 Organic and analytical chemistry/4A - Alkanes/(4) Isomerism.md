#### Structural isomers

Structural isomers - compounds with the same [[(2) Empirical and molecular formula|molecular formula]] but a **different** [[(2) Representing organic molecules#Structural formula|structural formula]]

For example, the following are all isomers of pentan-1-ol

| Isomer                  | Skeletal formula                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Pentan-1-ol             | ![[Pasted image 20241203104345.png]] |
| Pentan-2-ol             | ![[Pasted image 20241203104351.png]] |
| 2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol | ![[Pasted image 20241203104357.png]] |
| 2-methylbutan-1-ol      | ![[Pasted image 20241203104402.png]] |
| 2-methylbutan-2-ol      | ![[Pasted image 20241203104407.png]] |
| methoxybutane           | ![[Pasted image 20241203104414.png]] |

##### Types of isomerism
There are three types of structural isomerism:
1. Chain
2. Position (of a functional group)
3. (Type of) [[(3) Functional groups|functional group]]

###### Chain isomers
This is where the length of the chain varies, e.g. a pentane becoming a methylbutane.

##### Positional isomers
This is where the position of the functional group changes along the chain, e.g. pentan-1-ol and pentan-2-ol.

##### Functional group isomers
This is where isomers have different functional groups. Alcohols and ethers can be isomers, as well as alkenes and cyclical alkanes, and aldehydes and ketones.
