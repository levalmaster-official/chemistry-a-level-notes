#### Types of formulae
The structure of an organic molecule can be represented with different types of **formulae**
##### General formulae
- The simplest algebraic formula of a member of a [[(3) Functional groups|homologous series]], e.g. for an alkane $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$
##### Structural formula
- The minimal detail that shows the arrangement of atoms in a molecule, e.g. for butane $\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH3}$
- Each carbon in the main chain with what it is attached to written in one line
- Branches are shown in brackets
##### Displayed formulae
- The relative positioning of atoms and the bonds between them
- Every bond is shown
- Included O-H and C-H bonds
- E.g. for ethene:

##### [[(2) Empirical and molecular formula|Molecular formulae]]
- Each element symbol is only used once, e.g. $\ce{C6H14}$
##### Skeletal formula
- The simplified organic formula, shown by removing hydrogen atoms from alkyl chains, leaving just a carbon skeleton and associated [[(3) Functional groups|functional groups]]
- Each corner is a carbon atom
- Each line is a bond between carbons
- C-H bonds are not shown
