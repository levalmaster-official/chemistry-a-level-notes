#### Alkanes
Alkanes are a [[(3) Functional groups#Homologous series|homologous series]] of saturated hydrocarbons, containing single C-H and C-H bonds. 

Each carbon atom in an alkane has 4 bonding pairs and no lone pairs of electrons surrounding it, so all the bond angles are 109.5Â°. Each carbon exhibits a **tetrahedral** shape.

> [!TLDR] Summary
> - Saturated [[(3) Functional groups#Organic molecules|aliphatic]] hydrocarbons
> - Straight chain alkanes have the general formula $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$
> - Alicyclic alkanes have the [[(2) Representing organic molecules#General formulae|general formula]] $\ce{C_nH_2_n}$ 
> - Straight chain alkanes are named based on how many carbons are found in the chain.
> - [[(3) Functional groups|Functional group]] is C-H

##### Variations in boiling points of alkanes

> [!QUESTION] Why do the boiling points of alkanes increase with carbon-chain length?
> - As the chain length increases, the number of electrons per molecule increases.
> - This increases the strength of the London forces between molecules.
> - Therefore the London forces require more energy to break

> [!QUESTION] Why do the boiling point of alkanes increase with branching?
> - As the amount of branching increases, the boiling point decreases.
> - Unbranched (straight-chain) molecules can pack tightly together, with a large contact area between molecules. The London forces are strong and require a lot of energy to break.
> - Branched molecules cannot pack as tightly, so there is less contact area between molecules. The London forces are weaker and take less energy to break
##### Reactions of alkanes

Alkanes have strong bonds with very low polarity, and therefore they have very high bond enthalpy (large activation energy) and do not attract attacking species like ions or polar molecules very easily. Therefore, alkanes are generally very **unreactive**.

However, if the activation energy can be overcome, alkanes can react in a limited number of ways:
1. [[#Combustion|Combustion reactions]]
2. Halogenation reactions

###### Combustion
In a plentiful supply of oxygen, alkanes burn cleanly producing a blue flame. All the carbon atoms are oxidised to carbon dioxide, and all the hydrogen to water. This is known as **complete combustion**.

For example, the combustion of ethane:
$$\ce{C2H6 + 3 \frac{1}{2}O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O}$$
If the supply of oxygen is limited, a yellow flame is seen, Instead of carbon dioxide, the carbon may form carbon monoxide, or carbon (soot). All the hydrogen atoms still oxidise to water. This is known as **incomplete combustion**.

For example, the combustion of ethane to form carbon monoxide:
$$\ce{C2H6 + 2 \frac{1}{2} O2 -> 2CO + 3H2O}$$
###### Problems with incomplete combustion
1. Both carbon monoxide and particulate carbon (soot) are dangerous to human health
2. Carbon monoxide is **toxic** - it binds tightly to haemoglobin instead of oxygen, preventing oxygen from being transported in the blood to respiring tissues
3. Soot can cause respiratory issues
4. The soot from incomplete combustion also stains and damages.
