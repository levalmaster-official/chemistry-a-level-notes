#### First ionisation energy
- First ionisation energy - the amount of energy required to remove 1 mol of electrons from 1 mol of gaseous atoms of an element (to produce 1 mol of gaseous ions with a charge of 1+)
$$\ce{X_{(g)} -> X+_{(g)} + e-}$$
#### Successive ionisation energies
- Elements can have as many ionisation energies as they have multiple electrons.
- They always involve removing 1 electron from 1 mol of gaseous ions to increase their charge by 1.
- Ionisation energies are always successive, i.e. the 5th ionisation energy would be removing the 5th electron only already having removed 4 other electrons
- Successive ionisation energies always take **more** energy, since the next electron experiences a greater force of attraction
	- Taking successive electrons from the same shell requires more energy as the atomic radius between the nucleus and the outer shell electrons decrease slightly as the nuclear charge that each electron experiences is greater
	- The energy required to remove an electron from an inner shell is much greater than from an outer shell since the atomic radius decreases (increasing the nuclear attraction) and the number of inner shells decrease (increasing the nuclear attraction)
#### Factors affecting ionisation energy

Nuclear attraction is the strength of the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electron. 

> [!NOTE] How does nuclear attraction affect ionisation energy?
> The most loosely held electron is lost in each ionisation. This is the electron in the highest energy shell which experiences the least attraction from the nucleus. The force of the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electron must be overcome for the electron to be lost, this is the ionisation energy. Therefore the greater the nuclear attraction, the greater the ionisation energy

The following factors affect nuclear attraction:
- **Atomic radius** - the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electron. As the atomic radius increases, the nuclear attraction decreases  
- **Nuclear charge** - the number of protons in the nucleus. As the nuclear charge increases, nuclear attraction increases
- **Electron shielding** - electrons are negatively charges and so inner shell electrons repel outer shell electrons. This repulsion is known as shielding. As the number of inner shells increase, the nuclear attraction decreases

#### Trends in first ionisation energies
##### Across a period
- The number of inner shells remains constant, so the degree of nuclear shielding is constant.
- However, the nuclear charge increases (the number of protons increases), which increases the nuclear attraction.
- In addition, this decreases the atomic radius (as electrons experience a greater force of attraction), which further increases the nuclear attraction.
- This means that across a period, the first ionisation energy tends to increase.

##### Down a group
- The number of inner shells increases, which increases the degree of nuclear shielding, decreasing the nuclear attraction.
- This also means that there is a large increase in nuclear radius, decreasing the nuclear attraction.
- Despite having a greater nuclear charge, the increase in shielding and atomic radius means that there tends to be an overall lower nuclear attraction, and hence first ionisation energy, going down the group.
