### Atomic masses
- Ion - an atom (or group of atoms) that has gained or lost electrons

- Relative isotopic mass - the mass of an isotope compared to an atom of carbon-12
	- Atoms weigh less than the sum of their constituent subatomic particles. This difference is how much more stable an atom is compared to its parts, as described by $E=mc^2$. When atoms are formed, energy is released, which is directly proportional to mass.

- Relative atomic mass ($A_r$) - the weighted mean mass of an atom of an element compared with one twelfth of the mass of an atom of carbon-12
	- This is not the same as 'mass number' (the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, which will always be a whole number)
	- The data needed to calculate relative atomic mass comes from [[#Mass spectrometry]]
$$
\text{Relative atomic mass} = \frac{\Sigma \text{(isotope abundance}\times\text{isotopic mass number)}}{\Sigma\text{(Isotope abundance)}}
$$
- Relative atomic mass can be used to calculate masses for more complex particles/structures, by adding up to $A_r$ of every atom in one molecule (for simple molecules) or one formula unit (for giant structures)

#### Mass spectrometry

> [!NOTE] Extra information
> How mass spectrometry works is not needed for the OCR specification

1. Gaseous particles are injected into the spectrometer and hit with a high energy beam of electrons
		A mass spectrometer separates out particles according to the charge/mass ratio ($m/z$) by bending their paths in a magnetic field.
		If they were not ionised they would be neutral. This means they would all have the same charge/mass ratio (=0). So none of the particles would get their paths bent by the magnetic field.)
1. The ions are accelerated by an electrical field
2. The ions hit the detector, the lowest mass first, the highest mass last
3. The detector is read by a computer

#### Interpreting mass spectra
- The data produced by mass spectrometry appears in the form of a graph called a mass spectrum. The x-axis is the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions, and the y-axis is relative abundance, abundance, or intensity.
- For a single charge, the $m/z$ is equal to the relative isotopic mass
