#### Moles
Mole - the amount of substance containing as many particles as there are carbon atoms in 12g of the carbon-12 isotope

> 1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12; its symbol is ’mol.’  
> 2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles.
> - IUPAC, 1971

> The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant $N_A$, when expressed in $\text{mol}^{-1}$ , and is called the Avogadro number.
> - IUPAC, 2018


> [!NOTE] A dozen silicon atoms?
> A mole simply describes a number of particles, similar to the quantifier "dozen". This number of particles is equal to Avogadro's number, $N_A$, and is equal to $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities

##### Types of particle mass
- For individual atoms, [[(1) Atomic masses#Atomic masses|relative atomic mass]] is used ($A_r$)
- For simple molecules, relative molecular mass is used, where you must add up the $A_r$ of every atom in one molecule ($M_r$)
- For giant structures, relative formula mass is used, where you must add up the $A_r$ of every atom in one formula unit ($M_r$)

##### Molar mass
- Molar mass - the mass of one mole of a substance, with units $\text{gmol}^{-1}$ 
- The molar mass of a substance is equal to its $A_r$ or $M_r$ 
- This relationship is expressed by the following equation:

$$\text{Moles (mol)} = \frac{\text{ mass (g) }}{\text{ molar mass (gmol}^{-1})}$$

$$n = \frac{m}{M_r}$$
