#### Solutions
- A solute is the substance being dissolved
- A solvent is the liquid able to dissolve a solute
- A **solution** is a solute *dissolved* in a solvent

> [!NOTE] Aqueous solutions
> In aqueous solutions the solution is water. These substances are given the state symbol (aq)

In order for a substance to dissolve, the forces of attraction made in the solution must be stronger than the bonds/intermolecular forces broken in the solvent and the solute. If this is not the case, a substance will not dissolve.

#### Calculating concentration
The concentration of solution describes the amount of solute dissolved in a given quantity of solvent.

For aqueous solutions we often use a very specific definition:
- The amount of solute in [[(1) The Mole#Moles|moles]] dissolved in water to make $1 \text{ dm}^3$ of solution

Chemists use $[...]$ to indicate concentration, e.g. $\ce{[H+]}$ = “the concentration of hydrogen ions

$$\text{Concentration (moldm}^{-3}) = \frac{\text{moles of solute (mol)}}{\text{volume of solution (dm}^3)}$$
#### Terminology of solutions
- Weak - a solution in which a dissolved molecule partially dissociates to form dissolved ions
- Strong - a solution in which a dissolved molecule fully dissociates to form dissolved ions
- Concentrated - a solution with concentration > 1M ($1\text{moldm}^{-3}$)
- Dilute - a solution with concentration ≤ 1M ($1\text{moldm}^{-3}$)

#### Standard solutions
A standard solution is a solution where we know its concentration. As the concentrations of solutions can change over time, this means that in order to be sure we have a standard solution, we must either:

- Make the standard solution from scratch
- Perform a titration experiment 

##### Making a standard solution

> [!NOTE] Common exam question
> This method needs to be **learnt** as it is a common exam question worth 3-4 marks

1. Weigh out your solute into a small beaker
2. Fully dissolve your solute in a minimum amount of solvent and stir with a glass rod
3. Pour your solution into a volumetric flask, wash the glass rod and the beaker into the flask using more solvent
4. Top your flask up using a teat pipette until the meniscus of the water is sitting on the line of the flask, like a contact lens on a finger, invert to mix.
