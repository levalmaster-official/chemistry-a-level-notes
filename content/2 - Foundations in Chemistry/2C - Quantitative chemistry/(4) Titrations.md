##### Titration
A titration is a technique where [[(4) Concentration of solutions|a solution of known concentration]] is used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.

Typically, the titrant (the known solution) is added from a burette to a known quantity of the analyte (the unknown solution) until the reaction is complete.

An indicator is often used to help identify the end point of the titration, where the [[(3) Hydrated salts|stoichiometry]] of the chemical equation matches the [[(1) The Mole|moles]] of reactants used in the reaction.

By calculating the moles of the titrant, we can determine the moles of the analyte, and therefore its concentration.

##### Titration method

> [!NOTE] Extra information 
> The method for titration will not come up in the exam, however it is useful to know for the practical endorsement

1. Rinse and fill the burette with a standard solution of known concentration
2. Rinse and use a volumetric pipette to transfer a fixed quantity of the solution with unknown concentration to a conical flask
3. Add any additional reactants, or indicators. This will typically be **methyl orange** at school
4. *Do a rough titration to give a general idea of the expected titre*
5. Run the solution in the burette into the conical flask, adding dropwise near the endpoint until a colour change is observed
6. Continue until 2 concordant titres (ideally within $0.10\text{cm}^3$ of each other) are recorded

##### Recording titration data
Titration data should always be recorded in a table like the one below:

| Titration NÂº                              | Rough | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| Final burette reading ($\text{cm}^{3}$)   |       |     |     |     |
| Initial burette reading ($\text{cm}^{3}$) |       |     |     |     |
| Titre ($\text{cm}^{3}$)                   |       |     |     |     |
| Used in average? (Y/N)                    | N     |     |     |     |
