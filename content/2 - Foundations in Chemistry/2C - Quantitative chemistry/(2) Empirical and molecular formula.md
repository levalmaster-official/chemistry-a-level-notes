##### Empirical formula

- Empirical formula - the simplest whole number ratio of atoms (or [[(1) The Mole|moles]]) of each element present in a substance
- The formula of [[ionic]] compounds are always written as empirical formula
- This is appropriate as ionic compounds make up giant structures with varying numbers of ion present in each crystal

##### Molecular formula

- Molecular formula - the actual number of atoms present in a molecule
- The formula of [[covalent molecules]] are usually written as molecular formula
- This is most appropriate as covalent molecules make up simple structures with a fixed number of atoms present in each molecule
